# Morse Encoder and Decoder 

  This project implements a Morse code encoder and decoder in Java. It provides functionality to convert plain text into Morse code and decode Morse code back into readable text. The conversion is based on a predefined mapping of characters to Morse code symbols. It uses HashMaps for efficient lookups of characters and their corresponding Morse code representations.

* Each character in a word is converted to its Morse code equivalent, separated by a single space.

* Words are separated by three spaces in the Morse code.
